# Dec Party Manager Deployment Guide

How to deploy a Dec Party Manager node to Kubernetes from scratch.

Configuration is supplied entirely through environment variables (no mounted TOML file or ConfigMap). The HTTP admin UI is served behind an Ingress and gated by an identity provider (Keycloak or Auth0), while the Noise transport port is exposed publicly so other participants can reach you. The node generates a Noise keypair on first start and persists its database and keypair on a PersistentVolume, so a node keeps its identity across restarts and image upgrades.

This guide assumes:
- One participant per cluster (the most common external setup).
- A working Kubernetes cluster with a Traefik (or other) Ingress controller.
- Access to a Keycloak realm (or Auth0 tenant) you control, or that an operator has set up for you.
- You already have a Canton participant node running and reachable from the cluster.

## Deployment at a glance

1. **Pull the latest image tag** and prepare the manifests (Secret, Deployment + PVC, Service, Ingress).
2. **Set up the identity-provider client** that gates the admin UI (one public SPA client per deployment).
3. **Apply the manifests** and let the node start clean.
4. **Share public keys** with the other participants and add them as peers in the UI.
5. **Enter party credentials** (per-party IdP client info) through the UI.

The longest step is usually the cross-team coordination needed to exchange Noise public keys once everyone is deployed.

## 1 — Get the image

The Dec Party Manager is published as a public container image:

```
public.ecr.aws/dlc-link/decentralization-manager:<tag>
```

Use the latest tagged release (for example `v1.6.2`). Pin the version explicitly — do not use `latest`. If your cluster cannot pull from Public ECR directly, mirror the image into your own registry first.

> [!NOTE]
> Releases before v1.6.0 were published under the old repository name,
> `public.ecr.aws/dlc-link/canton-decparty-manager`. That repository stays up for
> existing pins, but new releases only go to `decentralization-manager` — update
> your manifests when you upgrade.

The image is distroless: it contains the `dec-party-manager` binary (entrypoint
`dec-party-manager serve`, binary on `PATH`) and no shell or coreutils. Run
anything that needs `sh` — init containers, `kubectl exec` debugging, exec
probes — on a utility image such as `busybox`, not on this image. The
Deployment example below shows the pattern.

To check the version of a running pod:

```bash
kubectl -n <your-namespace> get deploy dec-party-manager -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

Bumping the tag in the Deployment manifest and re-applying is how you upgrade going forward. The application runs any required SQL migrations against its SQLite database automatically on startup, so a tag bump is the only operator step between releases.

## 2 — Set up the identity-provider client

The admin UI authenticates users through your identity provider using the **Authorization Code flow with PKCE**, so it needs a dedicated **public** client. Configure either Keycloak **or** Auth0 — the two providers are mutually exclusive at config-load time.

> [!WARNING]
> There is an `--insecure` / `DECPM_INSECURE` mode that bypasses the identity provider entirely (any inbound token is accepted and an unsafe shared-secret token is sent to Canton). It exists for local development against an unsafe-auth Canton and **must never be set in a production deployment.** Leave it unset (the default) for every environment described in this guide.

### Keycloak

You need a **public** client in your realm. The client ID you choose here is what goes into `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` in the Secret below; there is no client secret to copy because public SPA clients don't have one.

In the Keycloak admin console, **Clients → Create client**:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Client type | OpenID Connect |
| Client ID | `dec-party-manager` (or any value — must match `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`) |
| Client authentication | **Off** (public client) |
| Authentication flow | **Standard flow** on; everything else off |
| Root URL | `https://<your-ui-host>` |
| Home URL | `https://<your-ui-host>` |
| Valid redirect URIs | `https://<your-ui-host>/*` |
| Valid post-logout redirect URIs | `https://<your-ui-host>/*` |
| Web origins | `https://<your-ui-host>` (or `+` to derive from the redirect URIs) |

**Web Origins** is the one that catches people out: without it, the browser blocks the SPA's token requests with a CORS error and login silently fails. Set it to your UI host explicitly, or use `+` to mirror the redirect URIs.

In **Advanced → Proof Key for Code Exchange Code Challenge Method**, set the value to `S256`. The frontend always sends PKCE; Keycloak rejects the request if the client isn't configured to expect it.

If you set `DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE` in the Secret (recommended for any shared deployment), also create a realm role with that exact name and assign it to whichever users should have admin powers. Without `DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE` set, every authenticated user is treated as admin.

Per-party Keycloak clients used to fetch Canton ledger tokens are **different** — they are confidential clients (with a secret), one per decentralized party, and you wire them up through the admin UI in Step 5, not here.

### Auth0

If your organization already uses Auth0, you can run the admin UI against Auth0 instead of Keycloak. Set the `DECPM_AUTH0_*` trio in the Secret (and leave the `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_*` trio unset). The setup mirrors the Keycloak one: a public SPA application for the browser, plus an API resource whose identifier becomes the audience the SPA requests tokens for.

**1. Create the API** (Auth0 dashboard → **Applications → APIs → Create API**):

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Decentralization Manager` (display only) |
| Identifier | `https://dec-party-manager/api` (or any unique URI — this is `DECPM_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`) |
| Signing algorithm | `RS256` |

The Identifier never needs to resolve — Auth0 treats it as an opaque string. Pick something stable; changing it later invalidates all issued tokens.

**2. Create the SPA application** (Auth0 dashboard → **Applications → Applications → Create Application**):

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Application type | **Single Page Application** |
| Allowed Callback URLs | `https://<your-ui-host>` |
| Allowed Logout URLs | `https://<your-ui-host>` |
| Allowed Web Origins | `https://<your-ui-host>` |
| Token Endpoint Authentication Method | None (public client) |
| Grant Types | Authorization Code, Refresh Token |

In the application's **APIs** tab, **authorize** it against the API you just created so the SPA is allowed to request tokens with that audience.

**3. Fill the Secret** using values from the Auth0 dashboard:

- `DECPM_AUTH0_DOMAIN` = the tenant domain shown on the application page (for example `your-tenant.us.auth0.com` — no scheme).
- `DECPM_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` = the application's **Client ID**.
- `DECPM_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` = the API **Identifier** from step 1.
- `DECPM_JWT_ROLE_CLAIM` = a URI-namespaced claim owned by your deployment (for example `https://example.com/decman/roles`) when using the admin-role gate.

**Allowed Web Origins** plays the same role as Keycloak's Web Origins — without it the browser blocks the SPA's token requests with CORS errors. Set it to your UI host; do not rely on Auth0 deriving it from callback URLs.

**Admin role**: Auth0 does not embed roles in access tokens by default. If you set `DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE`, you must also add an Action under **Actions → Library → Build Custom** that copies the user's role into the token. A minimal Action looks like:

```js
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const roles = event.authorization?.roles || [];
  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim("https://example.com/decman/roles", roles);
};
```

Set `DECPM_JWT_ROLE_CLAIM=https://example.com/decman/roles`, replacing the
example namespace with one controlled by your deployment. Attach the Action to
the Login flow, then create the matching role under **User Management → Roles**
and assign it to the appropriate users. DecMan also supports the standard flat
`roles`, `realm_access.roles`, and `scope` carriers without this setting.

## 3 — Apply the manifests

Below is the core single-participant manifest set. Replace every `<...>` placeholder with values for your environment, save as a file, and apply with `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`. Public exposure of the Noise port is environment-specific and is covered under "Service" below.

### 3a. Namespace (skip if it already exists)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <your-namespace>
```

### 3b. Secret (configuration)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dec-party-manager-secrets
  namespace: <your-namespace>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # Public address that peers use to reach this node over the Noise transport.
  # Must be reachable from the public internet on the Noise port (9000 by default).
  DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS: "<your-public-host>"

  # Canton participant node connection (Admin + Ledger gRPC APIs).
  DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_HOST: "<canton-admin-host>"
  DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_PORT: "5002"
  DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_HOST: "<canton-ledger-host>"
  DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_PORT: "5001"
  DECPM_CANTON_NETWORK: "mainnet"          # mainnet | testnet | devnet
  DECPM_CANTON_SYNCHRONIZER: "global"

  # Set when the participant serves its APIs over TLS. Point the CA vars at
  # the issuing CA if it is a private one; omit them to use the platform
  # trust store. See the environment table below for mTLS and SNI overrides.
  # DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS: "true"
  # DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS_CA_CERT: "/etc/decman/tls/canton-ca.pem"
  # DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS: "true"
  # DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS_CA_CERT: "/etc/decman/tls/canton-ca.pem"

  # Keycloak (gates the admin UI).
  DECPM_KEYCLOAK_URL: "https://<your-keycloak-host>"
  DECPM_KEYCLOAK_REALM: "<your-realm>"
  DECPM_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: "<frontend-client-id>"

  # Optional: require a specific Keycloak role on every authenticated caller
  # before they can hit privileged endpoints (PUT /party-config, /kick, etc.).
  # If unset, every authenticated user is treated as admin — fine for a
  # single-operator deployment, dangerous for shared environments.
  # DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE: "decman-admin"

  # Optional: encryption key for secrets stored in the SQLite database
  # (Keycloak client secrets per party). Any sufficiently long random
  # passphrase — it is hashed with SHA-256 to derive the actual 32-byte
  # key. If unset, secrets are stored in plaintext in the DB.
  # DECPM_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY: "<long-random-passphrase>"

  # Optional: tighten CORS to a specific origin if the UI is served from a
  # different host than the API (reverse-proxy / dev server). Defaults to
  # same-origin only, which is correct for the Ingress setup below.
  # DECPM_ALLOWED_ORIGIN: "https://<your-ui-host>"

  # Noise transport timeouts (seconds). Defaults are usually fine.
  DECPM_TIMEOUT_HANDSHAKE: "30"
  DECPM_TIMEOUT_MESSAGE: "120"
  DECPM_TIMEOUT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: "3"
  DECPM_TIMEOUT_RETRY_DELAY: "5"
```

### 3c. Deployment + PersistentVolumeClaim

The PVC holds the SQLite database and the Noise keypair — keep it for the lifetime of the node. Deleting it regenerates the keypair (changing your public key, which forces every peer to re-add you) and wipes the peer list and party credentials.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:

  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:

          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
            - name: noise
              containerPort: 9000

          env:
            - name: RUST_LOG
              value: dec_party_manager=info,tokio_noise=error,hyper_noise=error
            # Logs are JSON on stdout by default. The collector indexes the
            # fields as attributes only where a log pipeline parses the line,
            # so this environment needs its own decman pipeline in dlc-infra.
            # Set DECPM_LOG_FORMAT=text for the console format instead.
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: dec-party-manager-secrets
      volumes:
        - name: data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: dec-party-manager-data
```

### 3d. Service

The deployment uses two Services. The first is a `ClusterIP` that backs the Ingress for the HTTP admin UI; the second is a `LoadBalancer` that exposes the Noise port (9000) to the public internet so peers can reach you. Splitting them keeps `DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` pointed at a stable, dedicated endpoint and avoids putting the admin UI on a raw load balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dec-party-manager
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
    - name: noise
      port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: dec-party-manager
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dec-party-manager-noise
  namespace: <your-namespace>
  annotations:
    # AWS EKS example — use the cloud-provider annotation appropriate for
    # your cluster (or omit for a Classic ELB / on-prem MetalLB).
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - name: noise
      port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: dec-party-manager
```

After applying, read the LoadBalancer's external hostname (or IP) with `kubectl -n <your-namespace> get svc dec-party-manager-noise` and set `DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` in the Secret to that value, then restart the Deployment so the new env is picked up. If you are not on EKS, replace the annotation with whatever your cluster's cloud-provider integration expects, or use a `NodePort` / MetalLB / external load balancer of your choice — the only requirement is that peers can reach port 9000 at `DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` over raw TCP. The HTTP UI does not need to be exposed publicly — it is reached through the Ingress (next).

### 3e. Ingress (Traefik example)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dec-party-manager
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  ingressClassName: traefik
  rules:
    - host: <your-ui-host>
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: dec-party-manager
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Adapt the `ingressClassName` and TLS configuration to your cluster's Ingress controller (nginx, Contour, etc.). Make sure `<your-ui-host>` resolves to the cluster and is registered as a valid redirect URI on your IdP client.

### Apply

```bash
kubectl apply -f <each-of-the-above>.yaml
kubectl -n <your-namespace> rollout status deploy/dec-party-manager
```

Once the pod is `Running`, hit `https://<your-ui-host>` in a browser. Your identity provider should challenge for login.

## 4 — Establish peers

On first start the node generates a Noise keypair. None of the other participants know your public key yet, and you do not yet know any of theirs. The peer list is built by exchanging public keys out-of-band.

The UI makes the round-trip simple. For each participant in your network:

1. Open the **Network** panel.
2. Click **Share my data** — this copies your own peer entry (participant id, friendly name, public address, Noise port, public key) to the clipboard as JSON.
3. Send that JSON to your peer through whatever out-of-band channel you use (chat, email, ticket).
4. When a peer sends you their JSON, click **Paste from Clipboard** in your **Network** panel and save. The peer is added with all the right fields filled in.

Repeat with every participant. The "Participants Status" indicators turn green within seconds once both sides have added each other.

## 5 — Enter party credentials

For each decentralized party your node manages, open the "Party Config" dialog and enter the Keycloak settings (URL, realm, client ID, client secret). The application uses these to obtain Canton ledger tokens on behalf of each party.

## Configuration reference

Most variables have a default that's only useful for local development (loopback Canton, devnet, etc.). For a Kubernetes deployment you should set every variable in the "Set for K8s" column even when there is a code default — the defaults shown are what the binary falls back to if the variable is unset, not what your cluster wants.

| Variable | Code default | Set for K8s? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DECPM_LISTEN_ADDRESS` | `0.0.0.0` | optional | Noise transport bind address |
| `DECPM_NOISE_PORT` | `9000` | optional | Noise transport port |
| `DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` | falls back to `DECPM_LISTEN_ADDRESS` | **yes** | Hostname peers use to reach this node from the public internet |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | **yes** | Canton Admin API host |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_PORT` | `5002` | optional | Canton Admin API port |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | **yes** | Canton Ledger API host |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_PORT` | `5001` | optional | Canton Ledger API port |
| `DECPM_CANTON_SYNCHRONIZER` | `global` | optional | Synchronizer name |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS` | `false` | optional | Speak TLS to the Admin API. Leave off for a participant reachable only over a trusted private network |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS_CA_CERT` | unset | optional | PEM of the CA that issued the Admin API certificate. Required when that CA is private; the platform trust store is used when unset |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS_CLIENT_CERT` | unset | optional | PEM client certificate, for an Admin API requiring mTLS. Set with the key |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS_CLIENT_KEY` | unset | optional | PEM client key matching the certificate |
| `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS_DOMAIN` | unset | optional | Name to validate the Admin API certificate against, when it differs from the host — e.g. a certificate issued for a service DNS name while DecMan connects by IP |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS` | `false` | optional | As above, for the Ledger API |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS_CA_CERT` | unset | optional | |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS_CLIENT_CERT` | unset | optional | |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS_CLIENT_KEY` | unset | optional | |
| `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS_DOMAIN` | unset | optional | |
| `DECPM_CANTON_NETWORK` | `devnet` | **yes** | `mainnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` |
| `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_URL` | unset | **yes**¹ | Keycloak server URL for frontend auth |
| `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_REALM` | unset | **yes**¹ | Keycloak realm |
| `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | unset | **yes**¹ | Keycloak client used by the SPA |
| `DECPM_AUTH0_DOMAIN` | unset | **yes**¹ | Auth0 tenant domain for frontend auth (mutually exclusive with `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_*`) |
| `DECPM_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | unset | **yes**¹ | Auth0 SPA client ID |
| `DECPM_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` | unset | **yes**¹ | Auth0 API audience targeted by SPA tokens |
| `DECPM_JWT_ROLE_CLAIM` | unset | optional | Provider-specific JWT claim containing a role-name array; typically required for Auth0's namespaced custom claim |
| `DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE` | unset | recommended | IdP role required for privileged endpoints. If unset, every authenticated caller is treated as admin. |
| `DECPM_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | same-origin | optional | CORS origin if UI host ≠ API host |
| `DECPM_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | unset | recommended | Random passphrase (hashed via SHA-256) protecting party secrets at rest. If unset, secrets are stored in plaintext in the SQLite DB. |
| `DECPM_TIMEOUT_HANDSHAKE` | `30` | optional | Noise handshake timeout (seconds) |
| `DECPM_TIMEOUT_MESSAGE` | `120` | optional | Noise message timeout (seconds) |
| `DECPM_TIMEOUT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | optional | Connection retry attempts |
| `DECPM_TIMEOUT_RETRY_DELAY` | `5` | optional | Connection retry delay (seconds) |
| `DECPM_LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | optional | Leave it unset in a cluster, because the log pipeline parses JSON only. `text` gives the console format for local work |

¹ Required only for the chosen provider. Set the `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_*` trio **or** the `DECPM_AUTH0_*` trio, not both.

## Note: keeping the existing Noise keypair

If you would rather not regenerate your Noise keypair (so peers don't have to update their entry for you), you can preserve the keypair file from your old PVC. The keypair is stored as a file in the data directory (not in the SQLite database), so it survives a clean redeploy as long as you keep the same PVC mounted at `/app`.

The peer list and party credentials do **not** carry over: those live in the SQLite database, which the new format introduces. The first time the new application starts on the preserved PVC it will create a fresh database alongside the existing keypair file. You will still need to re-establish peers (Step 5) and re-enter party credentials (Step 6) — the only thing you save is the round-trip with peers having to update their entry for you.

## Upgrading an existing mesh to concurrent workflows

The concurrent multi-instance workflow release changes the **Noise wire
format**: every frame now starts with a protocol-version byte and carries an
instance-routing field. Frames from older builds are rejected with an explicit
"protocol version mismatch" error (and old builds cannot parse new frames). A mixed-version mesh
does not degrade gracefully — every cross-node call (heartbeats, invites,
workflow commands) fails until all nodes run the same side of the change.

**Upgrade lockstep, not rolling:**

1. Ensure no workflow is in flight on any node (finish or cancel + dismiss
   everything in the feed).
2. Stop **all** dec-party-manager processes in the mesh.
3. Upgrade every node to the new image/binary.
4. Start them all again. SQLite migrations `000013` (drops the
   one-InProgress-run-per-kind index) and `000014` (adds
   `coordinator_instance` to `workflow_runs`) apply automatically on boot.

Peer-side rows created before the upgrade have no `coordinator_instance`;
their resumed command streams route via a single-active-run fallback, which
cannot be disambiguated if the coordinator is already running several
workflows — another reason to upgrade with nothing in flight.

Both directions of the incompatibility are guarded at runtime: a 0.1.9+
coordinator refuses to start a workflow (409, naming the peers) unless every
invitee positively reports >= 0.1.9, and a 0.1.9+ node denies requests from
older builds with an explicit version-mismatch error in its logs.

Downgrading requires reversing migration `000014` and `000013`; note the
`000013` down-migration fails while concurrent InProgress rows exist (finish
or dismiss them first).

## Troubleshooting

- **Pod is `CrashLoopBackOff`**: `kubectl logs` will usually show a missing required env var. Compare against the configuration reference above.
- **UI loads but login fails**: confirm `<your-ui-host>` is registered as a valid redirect URI on your IdP client, and that the `DECPM_KEYCLOAK_*` (or `DECPM_AUTH0_*`) env vars match the IdP. For Auth0, the SPA application must also have the configured audience listed in its Allowed Callback / API Authorization.
- **Peers shown as unreachable**: check that the Noise port (9000) is exposed publicly, that `DECPM_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` resolves to that endpoint, and that the peer has your current public key.
- **Every Canton call fails with `transport error` / `BrokenPipe`, immediately and permanently**: the channel's TLS setting does not match what the endpoint speaks. A plaintext client against a TLS listener has its connection closed on the first bytes, which looks identical to the participant being down. Confirm with `grpcurl -plaintext <host>:<port> list` — if that fails but `grpcurl <host>:<port> list` succeeds, the endpoint is TLS: set `DECPM_CANTON_ADMIN_TLS=true` (and `DECPM_CANTON_LEDGER_TLS=true` for the ledger API), plus `..._TLS_CA_CERT` when a private CA issued the certificate. The connect error message names the variable to change in either direction.
- **Privileged endpoints return 403**: you have `DECPM_ADMIN_ROLE` set but the calling user doesn't have that role assigned in the IdP, or `DECPM_JWT_ROLE_CLAIM` does not match the claim emitted by the IdP. Correct the claim configuration, grant the role, or unset the admin-role gate.
